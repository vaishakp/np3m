# Bayesian parameter estimation using stochastic sampling


## Plan

1. Why stochastic sampling?
    1. Posterior 
    1. The curse of dimensionality
    1. Need for samples: expectation values, visualization of posteriors, computing integrals.
    1. Evidence, Model comparison
1. Rejection sampling, its inefficiency
1. Importance sampling
1. Improve efficiency: asymptotically uncorrelated sampling
    1. Markov chain monte carlo
1. Integration schemes
    1. Nested sampling
1. The zoo of samplers: what's different
1. bilby 
    1. 4 param BBH
    1. 2 param BNS
    1. 4 param BNS tidal
    1. Bayesian hierarchical inference
1. Normalizing flows, Neural posterior estimation


# Tasks

1. Plot the mass distribution of BHs
1. Make slides on all points above
1. Make notebooks for above
1. Add a slide on neural PE
